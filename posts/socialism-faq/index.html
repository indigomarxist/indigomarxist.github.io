After the movement had been building in the square for seven weeks, unarmed soldiers were sent in to disperse the protesters, after which many soldiers were beaten to death, torched, and lynched. The New York Times death count went from 2600, to many thousands, to 8000, to tens of thousands. In reality only around ~200 (including soldiers) were killed or trampled, in smaller clashes outside the square. The on-scene New York Times reporter disavowed the article, especially about machine-gunning of protesters. <a href=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8555142/Wikileaks-no-bloodshed-inside-Tiananmen-Square-cables-claim.html>A wikileaks cable</a> from a US ambassador to the US state department, confirmed that no killings or machine-gunnings took place in the square.</li><li><a href=https://peds-ansichten.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1989-07-12_Lilley_Gallo_Tiananmen_WikiLeaks.pdf>Latin American diplomat eyewitness account of June 3-4 events on Tiananmen Square wikileaks (PDF)</a></li><li><a href=https://vimeo.com/448970787>There was a Spanish television crew that covered the entire Tiananmen Square incident as it unfolded.

This includes drugs such as Gardasil, Norplant, Cervarix. A South African newspaper declared: “We are guinea pigs for the drugmakers.” In the case of Gardasil, the drug-pushing was cloaked in the language of environmentalism, popular empowerment, and feminism.

Bill Gates warned of “huge population growth in <em>places where we don’t want it</em>, like Yemen and Pakistan and parts of Africa.”, echoing overpopulation fears that have inspired eugenicists since the time of Malthus. Population control is a form of social control, directly targeting the bodies and dignity of poor people, conditioning them to believe that life’s most intimate decisions are outside of their competence and control.</li><li>Elite charitable funds are a legal means of <strong>tax avoidance</strong>. Under US law, investments in charitable foundations are tax-free; moreover, investors are not required to sell their stock positions and may continue to vote their shares without restriction.

As of April 2021, fewer than 600 million vaccine doses have been administered around the world; three-quarters of those in just 10 mostly high-income countries. The timeline for supplying poor and middle-income countries with enough vaccines to achieve herd immunity, meanwhile, has been pushed into 2024. These numbers represent more than the “catastrophic moral failure” the director general of the WHO warned about. It is a stark reminder than any policy that obstructs or inhibits vaccine production risks being self-defeating for the rich countries defending exclusive rights and gobbling up the lion’s share of available vaccine supplies.</a></li><li><a href="https://mobile.edweek.org/c.jsp?cid=25920011&item=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.edweek.org%2Fv1%2Fblog%2F60%2Findex.html%3Fuuid%3D25408">Used philanthropy as a front to generate profits for businesses in the agricultural and health sectors.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/episode-45-the-not-so-benevolent-billionaire-bill-gates-and-western-media>Citations Needed - The Not-So-Benevolent Billionaire - Bill Gates and Western Media.</a></li><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/ragecomics/comments/11c1t1/internet_explorer_rfunny_said_i_should_post_it/c6lbhu2/>Post from a web developer about Microsoft&rsquo;s monopoly practices in the 1990s.</a></li><li><a href=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/revisiting-the-spectacular-failure-that-was-the-bill-gates-deposition/>Bill acting like a sociopath in the depositions for Microsofts anti-trust lawsuit</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/microsoft.md>Microsoft crimes masterpost.</a></li><li><a href=https://www.quora.com/Is-Bill-Gates-evil>How Bill Gates got rich / Is he really evil?</a></li><li><a href=http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/resources/gjn_gates_report_june_2016_web_final_version_2.pdf>His charities promote corporate interests above health care</a>.</li><li><a href=https://www.versobooks.com/books/2344-no-such-thing-as-a-free-gift>Book about the golden handcuffs of the philanthro-capitalism of Bill Gates.</a></li><li><a href=https://apnews.com/92dc914dd97c487a9b9aa4b006909a8c/AP-Exclusive:-Billionaires-fuel-US-charter-schools-movement>The Gates foundation has spent over $1B to break up public schools, in favor of private charter schools.</a> <a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-education-initiative-failure-2018-6>2</a>, <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/04/16/um-who-are-melinda-bill-gates-trying-kid/>3</a>, <a href=https://nancyebailey.com/2019/03/08/bill-melinda-gates-dont-discuss-their-takeover-of-americas-public-schools/>4</a></li><li>Despite the myth of his &ldquo;humble origins&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;rags to riches&rdquo; story, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Maxwell_Gates>his mother served on the board of directors for many corporations</a>, and comes from a wealthy banking family.
