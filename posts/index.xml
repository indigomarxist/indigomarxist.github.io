&lt;p>To emphasize the commonality
of the 99 percent, to declare deep enmity of interest with the 1 percent, is to do exactly what the
governments of the United States, and the wealthy elite allied to them-from the Founding Fathers to
now-have tried their best to prevent. Madison feared a &amp;ldquo;majority faction&amp;rdquo; and hoped the new
Constitution would control it. He and his colleagues began the Preamble to the Constitution with
the words &amp;ldquo;We the people &amp;hellip;,&amp;rdquo; pretending that the new government stood for everyone, and hoping
that this myth, accepted as fact, would ensure &amp;ldquo;domestic tranquility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-constitution">What is the Constitution?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A constitution is a set of fundamental principles and precedents according to which a state or an organization is governed. As a &lt;strong>foundational document&lt;/strong>, it outlines the relationship between its subsections, defines how laws are made, what&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problems">The problems&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>The cult of the constitution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="who-were-the-framers">Who were the framers?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There is an almost religious devotion to which most citizens hold up both the constitution, and the framers&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>As is the case with any codified document of law or principles, its important to figure out in whose interest it was written. There is no such thing as a neutral political document.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A class analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>By discovering this, we can go beyond apparantly&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Neutrality&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="reforming-the-constitution">Reforming the Constitution&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Limits of reformism. How does it get changed? Go through history of amendments. Mass struggle, revolts, protests, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go through how each clause oppresses workers in some way.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Never be deceived that the rich will allow you to vote away their wealth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>​&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution">The solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stop holding a highly flawed and vague document as an infallible religious text.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop glorifying the framers as enlightened beings, when in reality they were the class enemies of the workers then, just as much as now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Realize that bourgeois political processes cannot reform the constitution. Improvements only occur when politicians are threatened by violence and instability.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Instead of writing up a longer, meandering argument against Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, I found that his quotations themselves make the strongest argument for why he makes a terrible role model for the left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core concepts of his philosophy, Masculine virtue and elitism, the Superman, Will to Power, worship of warrior heroes and militarism, Anti-democracy, Anti-Socialism, Reverence for hereditary Aristocracy (whether Teutonic, or Roman), Anti-feminism, Anti-Christianity / Buddism, Biological determinism, are shown through his quotes. After getting past his love of contradictory statements, and his propensity to try to gain hipster cred through the shock-value of anti-moralism, we&amp;rsquo;re left with a system of thought that&amp;rsquo;s as aristocratic and supportive of the status quo as has ever existed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising that this proto-incel, lover of masculinity and war, who decried democracy, socialism, and feminism, who revered the Teutonic and Roman conquerors, would produce fertile material to be used by the Nazis, even if he wasn&amp;rsquo;t anti-semitic himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="great-man--aristocracy">Great man / Aristocracy&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is only nobility of birth, only nobility of blood. When one speaks of &amp;ldquo;aristocrats of the spirit,&amp;rdquo; reasons are usually not lacking for concealing something. As is well known, it is a favorite term among ambitious Jews. For spirit alone does not make noble. Rather, there must be something to ennoble the spirit. What then is required? Blood.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The possibility has been established for the production of&amp;hellip;a master race, the future &amp;ldquo;masters of the earth&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;made to endure for millennia — a higher kind of men who&amp;hellip;employ democratic Europe as their most pliant and supple instrument for getting hold of the destinies of the earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Will this aristocracy be a caste, and their power hereditary? For the most part yes, with occasional openings to let in new blood. But nothing can so contaminate and weaken an aristocracy rich vulgarians, after the habit of the English aristocracy; As it was such intermarriage that ruined the greatest governing body the world has ever seen: the aristocratic Roman senate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The European man nowadays [&amp;hellip;] glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;] In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans of this fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof; the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which its worthiest individuals and periods.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Superman can survive only by human selection, by eugenic foresight and an ennobling education.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The homogenizing of European man … requires a justification: it lies in serving a higher sovereign species that stands upon the former which can raise itself to its task only by doing this. Not merely a master race whose sole task is to rule, but a race with its own sphere of life, with an excess of strength … strong enough to have no need of the tyranny of the virtue-imperative.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Not Mankind, but Superman is the goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="anti-feminism">Anti-feminism&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>God created woman. And boredom did indeed cease from that moment — but many other things ceased as well! Woman was God&amp;rsquo;s second mistake.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Women are considered profound. Why? Because we never fathom their depths. But women aren&amp;rsquo;t even shallow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Woman&amp;rsquo;s love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love&amp;hellip; Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant&amp;hellip; she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak&amp;ndash;she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong&amp;hellip; Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the &amp;lsquo;powerful&amp;rsquo;, the &amp;lsquo;strong&amp;rsquo;, the men.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[I&amp;rsquo;ve grown] tired with disgust of all that is feminism and undisciplined rhapsody in that romanticism, that idealistic lying, that softening of the human conscience, which had conquered here one of the bravest souls [referring to Wagner].&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Man shall be educated for war, and women for the recreation of the warrior; everything else is folly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Man is for woman a means; the end is always the child. But what is woman for man? &amp;hellip; a dangerous toy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here is little of man; therefore women try to make themselves manly. For only he who is enough of a man will save the woman in woman.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is dangerous to try equality with a woman; she will not be content with that; she will be rather content with subordination if the man is a man. Above all, her perfection and happiness lie in motherhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="anti-socialism">Anti-Socialism&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Whom do I hate most among the rabble of today? The socialist rabble, the chandala apostles, who undermine the instinct, the pleasure, the worker’s sense of satisfaction with his small existence–who make him envious, who teach him revenge. The source of wrong is never unequal rights but the claim of “equal” rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>With feminism come socialism and anarchism; all of them the litter of democracy; if equal political power is just, why not equal economic power? There are some that preach my doctrine of life but at the same time are preachers of equality. &amp;hellip; I do not wish to be confounded with these preachers of equality. For within me justice saieth: &amp;ldquo;Men are not equal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;We wish to possess nothing in common&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A high civilization is a pyramid; it can stand only upon a broad base; its prerequisite is a strongly and soundly consolidated mediocrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Only a man of intellect should hold property.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Socialism itself can hope to exist only for brief periods here and there, and then only through the exercise of the extremest terrorism. For this reason it is secretly preparing itself for rule through fear and is driving the word “justice” into the heads of the half-educated masses like a nail so as to rob them of their reason… and to create in them a good conscience for the evil game they are to play.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The doctrine of equality! … But there is no more venomous poison in existence: for it appears to be preached by justice itself, when it is actually the end of justice.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Socialism&amp;ndash;as the logical conclusion of the tyranny of the least and the d***est, i.e., those who are superficial, envious, and three-quarters actors&amp;ndash;is indeed entailed by &amp;ldquo;modern ideas&amp;rdquo; and their latent anarchism; but in the tepid air of democratic well-being the capacity to reach conclusions, or to finish, weakens. One follows&amp;ndash;but one no longer sees what follows. Therefore socialism is on the whole a hopeless and sour affair; and nothing offers a more amusing spectacle than the contrast between the poisonous and desperate faces cut by today&amp;rsquo;s socialists&amp;ndash;and to what wretched and pinched feelings their style bears witness!&amp;ndash;and the harmless lambs&amp;rsquo; happiness of their hopes and desiderata.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[&amp;hellip;] In any case, even as a restless mole under the soil of a society that wallows in st***ity, socialism will be able to be something useful and therapeutic: it delays &amp;ldquo;peace on earth&amp;rdquo; and the total mollification of the democratic herd animal; it forces the Europeans to regain spirit, namely cunning and cautious care, not to abjure manly and warlike virtues altogether, and to retain some remnant of spirit, of clarity, sobriety, and coldness of the spirit&amp;ndash;it protects Europe for the time being from the marasmus femininus that threatens it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can the superman arise in such a soil [democracy]? And how can a nation become great when its greatest men lie unused, discouraged, perhaps unknown? Such a society loses character; imitation is horizontal instead of vertical; not the superior man but the majority man becomes the ideal and the model; everybody comes to resemble everybody else; even the sexes approximate - the men become women and the women become men.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Europe is threatened with a new Buddhism. [&amp;hellip;] The whole of the morality of Europe is based upon the values which are useful to the herd.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Railing against the Collectivism of Eastern philosophies:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The world has been Orientalized long enough; and men now yearn to be Hellenized.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="pro-war">Pro-war&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A declaration of war on the masses by higher men is needed! … Everything that makes soft and effeminate, that serves the end of the people or the feminine, works in favor of universal suffrage, i.e. the domination of the inferior men. But we should take reprisal and bring this whole affair to light and the bar of judgment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A herd of blond beasts of prey, a race of conquerors and masters, with military organizations, with the power to organize, unscrupulously placing their fearful paws upon a population perhaps vastly superior in numbers, &amp;hellip; this herd founded the State. The dream is dispelled which made the State begin with a contract. What has he to do with contracts who can command, who is master by nature, who comes on the scene with violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Freedom means that the manly instincts which delight in war and victory dominate over other instincts, for example, over those of &amp;ldquo;pleasure.&amp;rdquo; The human being who has become free — and how much more the spirit who has become free — spits on the contemptible type of well-being dreamed of by shopkeepers, Christians, cows, females, Englishmen, and other democrats. The free man is a warrior.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A good war halloweth any cause.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I felt for the first time that the strongest, highest Will to Life does not find expression in a miserable struggle for existence, but in a Will to War, a Will to Power, a Will to Over-Power!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself. What is bad? All that is born of weakness. What is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Does anybody at last understand, will anybody understand what the Renaissance was? The transvaluation of Christian values, the attempt undertaken with all means, all instincts and all genius to make the &lt;em>opposite&lt;/em> values, the &lt;em>noble&lt;/em> values triumph. [&amp;hellip;] Caesar Borgia as Pope. &amp;hellip; Do you understand me?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In contrast to all this, everyone ought to say to himself: ‘better to go abroad, to seek to become master in new and savage regions of the world and above all master over myself; to keep moving from place to place for just as long as any sign of slavery seems to threaten me; to shun neither adventure nor war and, if the worst should come to the worst, to be prepared for death: all this rather than further to endure this indecent servitude, rather than to go on becoming soured and malicious and conspiratorial!’ This would be the right attitude of mind: the workers of Europe ought henceforth to declare themselves as a class a human impossibility and not, as usually happens, only a somewhat harsh and inappropriate social arrangement; they ought to inaugurate within the European beehive an age of a great swarming-out such as has never been seen before, and through this act of free emigration in the grand manner to protest against the machine, against capital, and against the choice now threatening them of being compelled to become either the slave of the state or the slave of a party of disruption. Let Europe be relieved of a fourth part of its inhabitants!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="racism">Racism&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What follows, then? That one had better put on gloves before reading the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very advisable. One would as little choose early Christians for companions as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them — neither has a pleasant smell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only one solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor. To take a Jewish affair seriously — he cannot persuade himself to do that. One Jew more or less — what does it matter ?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Those races that cannot bear this philosophy are doomed; and those that regard it as the greatest blessing are destined to be the masters of the world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Instead of using plex or emby, consider using a dedicated torrent server, and torrent clients elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quality">Quality&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Streaming servers can &lt;strong>never&lt;/strong> have the same quality as local music / video players.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Video streaming servers like plex or emby, often have to transcode / convert the video to lower-quality formats. Native video players can handle &lt;code>x265&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Audio streaming servers often can&amp;rsquo;t handle high quality formats like &lt;code>flac&lt;/code>, whereas local media players can handle these easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="amount-of-content">Amount of Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The content on streaming services are limited to what you &lt;em>specifically&lt;/em> have downloaded. This can never match the hundreds of thousands of torrents being shared by people across the globe. Search sites like &lt;a href="https://torrents-csv.ml/">Torrents.csv&lt;/a> have often faster searching than self-hosted solutions (and you can self host the searching if you wish).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which is better, having a collection of &lt;em>my music&lt;/em>, or having a collection of &lt;em>all music&lt;/em>?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="choice-of-media-player">Choice of media player&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>With torrents, I can use &lt;strong>any media player I want&lt;/strong>. Most OSs make this as simple as a double-click to play media. VLC / MPV can natively play high quality video and audio, x265, flac, opus, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With streamers, I&amp;rsquo;m forced either to use a web client, or their own (often proprietary, sometimes paid) app. I prefer open-source standards like VLC.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="availability--reliability">Availability / Reliability&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Torrents have effectively solved the data distribution problem: content is shared in a web of connections, and a torrent with more than one seeder is already more resilient than the strongest streaming server.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why should there be 10,000 separate streaming services, not helping each other host or share the data, when torrents have made it so 10,000 clients &lt;strong>are helping each other share the data&lt;/strong>?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Services like plex don&amp;rsquo;t offer this shared hosting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Music / content is often removed from services like youtube frequently. Torrents can never be removed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People often goto video streaming sites, and these are taken down rapidly. Many torrents have been reliably shared for 10+ years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about hardware failure? If your streaming servers hard drive goes down, you lost everything. With torrents, any with more than one seeder is safe.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Streaming servers require you to set up a web server, often requiring you to learn nginx / apache, as well as follow various setup processes for the services themselves. This is understandable for some tech-oriented people, but what about a non-techie, who just likes music / movies? Why should they be required to learn these tools?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Content should be available &lt;strong>for all&lt;/strong>, regardless of technical skill, or ability.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Downloading a torrent, and enjoying the media, involves:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Clicking a download magnet link. Wait for it to finish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="caching--saving--streaming">Caching / Saving / Streaming&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many of us don&amp;rsquo;t have data, or are often in areas where data is spotty.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Its often a &lt;em>feature&lt;/em> of services like plex to be able to save media locally, to avoid this problem. This is default with torrents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Torrent clients like qbittorrent and libretorrent for android let you &lt;em>download files in sequential order&lt;/em>, IE stream, at the click of a button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Services like &lt;a href="https://torrents-csv.ml">Torrents.csv&lt;/a> let you search for files within torrents, so you can easily download / stream individual songs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Its your choice where things are downloaded to. You can have a desktop or server with a highly available torrent client, and/or a smartphone torrent client.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/tiananmen-the-massacre-that-wasnt/">It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a massacre of peaceful students, but a skirmish between PLA soldiers and armed detachments from the pro-capitalist / free market reform movement.&lt;/a> The protest movement, as evidenced by their own accounts, called for market liberalisation, and free market reforms, rallying around a replica of the statue of liberty. After the movement had been building in the square for seven weeks, unarmed soldiers were sent in to disperse the protesters, after which many soldiers were beaten to death, torched, and lynched. The New York Times death count went from 2600, to many thousands, to 8000, to tens of thousands. In reality only around ~200 (including soldiers) were killed or trampled, in smaller clashes outside the square. The on-scene New York Times reporter disavowed the article, especially about machine-gunning of protesters. &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8555142/Wikileaks-no-bloodshed-inside-Tiananmen-Square-cables-claim.html">A wikileaks cable&lt;/a> from a US ambassador to the US state department, confirmed that no killings or machine-gunnings took place in the square.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/448970787">There was a Spanish television crew that covered the entire Tiananmen Square incident as it unfolded. Their footage showed that there was no massacre. A few things worthy of pointing out - Liu Xiaobo and Hou Dejian, both student leaders of the Tiananmen protests, have been recorded as saying that they never saw anyone killed at the protests.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www.fightbacknews.org/2019/6/4/reflections-tiananmen-square-and-attempt-end-chinese-socialism">The protest movement followed the line of &amp;ldquo;color revolutions&amp;rdquo;, in which the US tried to destabilize and create counter-revolutions in eastern Europe and Latin America after the fall of the USSR.

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom">Actively feeds his own cult of personality, as it raises his company&amp;rsquo;s stock price.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-its-like-when-elon-musks-twitter-mob-comes-after-you">Criticism of Musk or Tesla is often met with toxic harrassment, especially against women.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/8tfmm6/why_is_there_a_cult_of_personality_around_elon/">Reddit: Why is there such a big cult of personality around Musk?&lt;/a> One such &amp;ldquo;Tony-Stark&amp;rdquo; from &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-the-architect-of-tomorrow-120850/">Rolling-Stone&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Despite rumours of Musk being a self-made mad scientist genius, he was born into a wealthy white South African family, and his &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2">father owns Emerald mines.&lt;/a> His wealth comes not from scientific discovery or innovation, but from his father funding his first business ventures, and from buying and selling companies such as PayPal, Zip2, SolarCity, SpaceX, and Tesla.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-donations-republicans_us_5b4e4bd8e4b0b15aba897481">Despite being hailed as a leader in the fight against climate change, he donates 7x more money to Republicans.&lt;/a> Is it any surprise that a union-busting capitalist donated heavily to the Republican Party?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Musk takes advantage of international crises to raise Tesla&amp;rsquo;s stock price. In one case, &lt;a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/20601/elon-musk-puerto-rico-privatization-utility-climate-solar-rossello">Musk promised to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; Puerto Rico&amp;rsquo;s power grid after it was decimated by Hurricane Maria.&lt;/a> He deploys solar panels to a hospital, dozens of &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/354154-musk-tesla-can-rebuild-puerto-rico-power-grid">news articles&lt;/a> were written about the &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/sally-hogshead/elon-musks-response-to-puerto-rico-is-pure-marketing-genius-should-be-required-reading.html">business-saviness of this decision&lt;/a>, and the stock price soared. PR reps told Musk they don&amp;rsquo;t want their power grid privatized by billionaries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a PR stunt, Musk promised to build a mini-submarine to rescue a boys soccer team that got trapped in a Thai cave in 2018. After receiving vitriol from the Thai and rescue community, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/unsworth-reply-elon-musk-fucking-idiot">Musk called one of the cave rescuers, a pedophile&lt;/a>,&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17576302/elon-musk-thai-cave-rescue-submarine">2&lt;/a>. After the rescuer sues Musk for defamation, Musk pays 50k to a private investigator (and former felon), &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/elon-musk-hired-felon-james-howard-higgins-dirt-pedo-guy">to dig up dirt on the rescuer.&lt;/a>, and was told to use &amp;ldquo;aggressive tactics&amp;rdquo;. Musk&amp;rsquo;s team then told the investigator: “We would like you to immediately move forward with ‘leaking’ this information to the UK press. Obviously must be done very carefully.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1181396377605029888">Musk and his team even lobbied the Thai gov and prime minister to get a local official to reverse a statement saying the mini-submarine wasn&amp;rsquo;t practical, before the children had been rescued.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goes after whistleblowers, including sending the police after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263757/tesla-elon-musk-employee-hack-spying-whistleblower-gigafactory-martin-tripp-drugs">Martin Tripp&lt;/a> ( who reported on Tesla&amp;rsquo;s fraudulent activities to the SEC ), who Musk claimed was an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp">active shooter.&lt;/a> Goes after several journalists who criticized him. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1197592445812232192?s=19">A twitter thread of the Nov 2019 swatting police report, and those targeted by Musk.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In another PR stunt in April 2020, after dismissing covid fears as &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1246265058839191554?s=20">he states that he will send 1k ventilators to the New York City hospital system. He ends up sending 40 out-of-spec ones, that doctors warn could spread the virus further.&lt;/a> He also claims that &lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUurKMRWsAANrsE?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=medium">SpaceX is working on ventilators.&lt;/a> After faltering first quarter 2020 Telsa sales, &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-anti-lockdown/">he goes on a twitter rant&lt;/a> to &amp;ldquo;FREE AMERICA NOW&amp;rdquo;, and demands that the lockdown be ended at its height in April 2020.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After the US-backed overthrow of Bolivia&amp;rsquo;s president Evo Morales (mainly for control of its lithium resources), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlytaDeLeon/status/1282765265386840066?s=20">the unelected interim opposition leader Jean Anez privatises Bolivia&amp;rsquo;s state lithium company, and invites Elon Musk to produce batteries there. He concurs, and Tesla&amp;rsquo;s stock price soars.&lt;/a> In response Elon Musk says: &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/CeMdDXq.png">&amp;ldquo;We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/real-agenda-gates-foundation/">He&amp;rsquo;s a philanthro-capitalist imperialist: using the bill and melinda gates foundation charity as a bargaining chip to work in the interests of billionaire elites.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZsjovp13f1xCA-4ewzOdqd">Youtube Audiobook&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://theecologist.org/2016/jan/21/gates-foundation-spearheading-neoliberal-plunder-african-agriculture">Gates spearheads the neoliberal plunder of African Agriculture.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Gates foundation tests pharmaceutical products on humans for profit, usually in poorer countries without regulatory bodies. &lt;a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/controversial-vaccine-studies-why-is-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-from-critics-in-india/amp_articleshow/41280050.cms">One such mass test, on behalf of Merck and Pfizer, of a harmful HPV vaccine on 23,000 girls in india kills 7 girls, sterilizes hundreds more, and leads to public outrage.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Gates foundation helps big pharma find test markets for their drugs, selling them in the global south. This includes drugs such as Gardasil, Norplant, Cervarix. A South African newspaper declared: “We are guinea pigs for the drugmakers.” In the case of Gardasil, the drug-pushing was cloaked in the language of environmentalism, popular empowerment, and feminism. Melinda Gates evoked “choice” in support of her family planning initiatives, but in reality was not poor women, but a handful of the world’s wealthiest people who have presumed to choose which methods of contraception will be delivered, and to whom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/philanthropy-charity-banga-carnegie-gates-foundation-development">Funnels hundreds of millions in grant money to corporations&lt;/a>, such as Mastercard, Merck, Pfizer, ABC, NBC, Univision, Scholastic, and Pearson.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philanthro-capitalism undermines local communities, dismantling their democracy and autonomy in health care, by making them fully dependent on US billionaires, who are completely unnaccountable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Philanthrocapitalists are currently rushing to take power in a system of global health and population control. Bill Gates warned of “huge population growth in &lt;em>places where we don’t want it&lt;/em>, like Yemen and Pakistan and parts of Africa.”, echoing overpopulation fears that have inspired eugenicists since the time of Malthus. Population control is a form of social control, directly targeting the bodies and dignity of poor people, conditioning them to believe that life’s most intimate decisions are outside of their competence and control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elite charitable funds are a legal means of &lt;strong>tax avoidance&lt;/strong>. Under US law, investments in charitable foundations are tax-free; moreover, investors are not required to sell their stock positions and may continue to vote their shares without restriction. By sheltering foundations, the US Treasury effectively co-finances the activities of Gates foundation and its investors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2020/07/08/bill-gates-global-health-policy/">The Bill Gates global health empire promises more empire and less public health.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since he is the largest donor to the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60885-0/fulltext">he pushes funding for &amp;ldquo;headline grabbers&amp;rdquo; such as Malaria and HIV, despite local experts telling policy-makers that other ailments such as Tuberculosis, malnutrition, and bacterial disease are the biggest causes of death.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://archive.is/9bkpq">During the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked on behalf of big pharma again to protect vaccine intellectual property rights, prioritizing wealthy northern countries over the global south. As of April 2021, fewer than 600 million vaccine doses have been administered around the world; three-quarters of those in just 10 mostly high-income countries. The timeline for supplying poor and middle-income countries with enough vaccines to achieve herd immunity, meanwhile, has been pushed into 2024. These numbers represent more than the “catastrophic moral failure” the director general of the WHO warned about. It is a stark reminder than any policy that obstructs or inhibits vaccine production risks being self-defeating for the rich countries defending exclusive rights and gobbling up the lion’s share of available vaccine supplies.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>8 variations of “Jewish?” (Charlie Chaplin), “Polish Jew, (Tom Driberg)” “English Jew,” or “Jewess.”&lt;/li>

&lt;li>His books Animal Farm and 1984 are used widely as anti-communist propaganda in schools in the US and UK. So much so that &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/">his animated animal farm film was funded by the CIA&lt;/a>. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason they teach George Orwell in schools and not Franz Fanon, Che, Huey P Newton, Malcolm X, Lenin, CLR James, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 1941, illustrator Elias Gertrude approached Orwell, then an editor for the British Ministry of information, with an idea for a satirical cartoon film, portraying the Nazis as pig characters ruling a farm in a kind of dysfunctional fairy story. &lt;a href="https://www.radnorshire-fine-arts.co.uk/brand/elias-gertrude-1913-1988/">He told her that there was not much call for her idea, stole it, changed the name from &lt;em>A Fairy Story&lt;/em> to &lt;em>Animal Farm&lt;/em>, and changed the pig-nazis into Communists.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war">Between 1952 and 1957, from three sites in West Germany, a CIA operation codenamed ‘Aedinosaur’ launched millions of ten-foot balloons carrying copies of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, and dropped them over Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia — whose airforces were ordered to shoot the balloons down.&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>After winning the Nobel peace prize, he dropped an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/america-dropped-26171-bombs-2016-obama-legacy">average of 30k bombs / year during his presidency, mostly on Muslim countries&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-bombed-iraq-syria-pakistan-afghanistan-libya-yemen-somalia-n704636">2&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wallacemick/status/1261744000396152842?s=20">3&lt;/a>. In 2016 alone, dropped &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html">26,171 bombs in the Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a>, up 3000 from the previous year. The countries bombed include Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04drones.html?smid=tw-share">Pakistan&lt;/a>, Libya, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/07/u-s-drone-strike-kills-more-than-150-in-somalia/?utm_term=.fbeafe46df71">Somalia&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Began a campaign of drone assassinations in the Middle East and Africa, in which &lt;strong>90% of those killed were not the intended targets, but &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers">innocent civilian bystanders&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, including women, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush/">children&lt;/a>, and US citizens. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_US_drone_strikes">1&lt;/a>. Drone strikes are used by the military and the CIA to hunt down and kill people the &lt;a href="https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/KC_Heads01.png">Obama administration&lt;/a> has deemed — through secretive processes, without indictment or trial — worthy of execution. He authorized &lt;a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2017/01/17/obamas-covert-drone-war-numbers-ten-times-strikes-bush/">10 times more drone strikes&lt;/a> than George W Bush, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html">2&lt;/a>. The Obama assassination program is detailed in the &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers">drone papers&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On 3 October 2015, he ordered a United States Air Force AC-130U gunship to attack the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike">Kunduz Trauma Centre&lt;/a> operated by Doctors Without Borders, in northern Afghanistan. The attack killed 42 people and wounded 30 more. The airstrike constitutes a war crime (attacks on hospitals are considered war crimes), and is the first instance of one Nobel peace prize winner (Obama) bombing and killing another (Doctors without borders). CNN and the New York Times deliberately obscured the US&amp;rsquo;s responsibility for the bombing, with the headline, &amp;ldquo;US is blamed after bomb hits afghan hospital&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike">1&lt;/a>,&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/cnn-and-the-nyt-are-deliberately-obscuring-who-perpetrated-the-afghan-hospital-attack/">2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In 2010, President Obama &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2010/04/07/assassinations_2/">directed the CIA&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/">assassinate an US citizen&lt;/a> in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, despite the fact that he had never been charged with any crime, killing him &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/sep/30/anwar-al-awlaki-yemen-live">with a September, 2011 drone strike&lt;/a>. Two weeks later, a separate CIA drone strike in Yemen &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/10/20/the_killing_of_awlakis_16_year_old_son/">killed his 16-year-old American-born son&lt;/a>, Abdulrahman, along with the boy’s 17-year-old cousin and several other innocent Yemenis. In a predictable display of bipartisanship, in January 2017, Trump ordered a SEAL strike, and reports from Yemen &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-yemen-qaeda-idUKKBN15D094">quickly surfaced&lt;/a> that 30 people were killed, including 10 women and children. Among the dead: the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar Awlaki, sister of the 16 year old killed by Obama. &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/">1&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2046634,00.html">Obama and Hillary Clinton rigged Haiti&amp;rsquo;s 2010 election, threatening the then-president with removing US financial aid, unless their OAS candidate, Michel Martelly, won the election, after he forced other popular candidates to drop out.&lt;/a> This is a continuation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Uphold_Democracy">&amp;ldquo;Operation uphold democracy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, in which US troops invaded Haiti to overthrow democratically elected president Jean-Baptiste Aristide in 1991, who is still in exile. &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/wikileaks-haiti-let-them-live-3-day/">Lobbied to lower Haiti&amp;rsquo;s minimum wage to $0.30 / hour.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obama continued backing &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/10/02/feigned-american-support-egyptian-democracy-lasted-roughly-six-weeks/">Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president who helped the US fight Saddam, giving him $2B every year&lt;/a>. After Mubarak was exposed for corruption in the 2009 Arab Spring, the US entered talks with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Suleiman">Suleiman, a CIA collaborator and Mubarak&amp;rsquo;s vice president intelligence chief known for torturing people on behalf of the US.&lt;/a> The US then granted him asylum and medical treatment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obama continued support for Israel and their genocide of Palestineans, leaving a parting gift of his presidency to Israel of &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-statement-idUSKCN11K2CI">$38B in military aid over the next 10 years.&lt;/a> “Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel’s security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood,” Obama wrote.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally acheived the US goal of overthrowing Gaddafi and destabilizing Libya. From 2011 onward, began conducting an extensive bombing campaign (&amp;gt;110 tomahawk cruise missiles) in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)">Libyan Civil Wars of 2011 and 2014&lt;/a>. This includes 7,700 air strikes, resulting in 30,000 -100,000 deaths. Loyalist towns were bombed to rubble and ethnically cleansed, and the country is in chaos as Western-trained and armed Islamist militias seize territory and oil facilities and vie for power. The Misrata militia, trained and armed by Western special forces, is one of the most violent and powerful in the world.&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2014%E2%80%93present)">1&lt;/a> The country has since collapsed into a chaos of child soldiers, slavery, and violence between extremist groups, a haunting repetition of what US imperialism has left in its wake in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. &lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/news/470321-libya-gaddafi-spokesman-interview/">An interview with Gaddafi&amp;rsquo;s former spokesman about the US overthrow of Libya.&lt;/a> When pressured, Obama stated that &amp;ldquo;not managing the aftermath of overthrowing Gaddafi&amp;rdquo; was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/barack-obama-says-libya-was-worst-mistake-of-his-presidency">&amp;ldquo;the greatest mistake of his presidency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obama went back on his campaign promise for a single-payer health care system, and removed the public option from his ACA ( a proposal mostly taken from Mitt Romney, and written by health-care industry moguls), which granted massive subsidies to empower the parasitic health insurance industry ( &lt;a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-industry-overview">~1.2 Trillion USD&lt;/a> ), forcing those unable to afford insurance to pay a $700 yearly fee for not having it ( called the &lt;a href="https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/individual-shared-responsibility-provision/">&amp;ldquo;shared responsibility provision&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> ). His ACA is essentially a huge govt subsidy directly into the pockets of private health companies along with a mandate that forced people to pay these companies as well.

&lt;li>The Obama era was one of the greatest decreases in working class and &lt;a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality">black wealth&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Foreclosed.pdf">2&lt;/a> in history: home equity decreased by ~$17k between 2007 and 2016. His housing policies led to millions losing their homes. While Wall street banks recieved $29 Trillion in bailouts, $75 Billion in relief was set aside for housing foreclosures and mortgage assistance. Instead of being paid to families, this was paid to mortgage servicers, and the services found ways to pocket the money and continue foreclosures: by the end of the program, less than 20% of the funds were used, and most had dropped out of the program due to foreclosures. The Obama administration refused to prosecute the fraud, or any of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/li>

Detainees are often held for a year without trial, with antiquated court procedures pushing back court dates for months, encouraging many to accept immediate deportation in the hopes of being able to return faster than the court can reach a decision, but forfeiting legal status, in a cruel system of coercion. After the creation of DHS and ICE, the budget for immigration enforcement doubled from &lt;a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery">$6.2 billion in 2002 to $12.5 billion in 2006 under Obama.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_detention_in_the_United_States#Criticisms">1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/opinions/reyes-immigration-detention/">2&lt;/a>,&lt;a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-enforcement-united-states-rise-formidable-machinery">3&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Scaled up the war on drugs, imprisoning minorities at far greater rates than ever historically. Gave no support to Black lives matter, the Ferguson protests, or the dakota access pipeline protests, allowing local authorities to brutally repress these movements.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs">War On Drugs&lt;/a>, a policy of arrest and imprisonment targeting minorities, first initiated by Nixon, has over the years created a monstrous system of mass incarceration, resulting in the imprisonment of 1.5 million people each year, with the US having the most prisoners per capita of any nation. One in five black Americans will spend time behind bars due to drug laws. The war has created a permanent underclass of impoverished people who have few educational or job opportunities as a result of being punished for drug offenses, in a vicious cycle of oppression. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs#cite_note-59">1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs">2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Nation_v._United_States_Forest_Service">In Navajo Nation v. United States Forest Service, she ruled against the Navajo nation, who have consistently protested US encroachment of a US forest-service run ski resort on Navajo territory known as the sacred San Francisco Peaks.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inyo_County_v._Paiute-Shoshone_Indians_of_the_Bishop_Community">In Inyo County v. Paiute-Shoshone Indians, the Paiute tribe asserted that it was against their privacy policy to allow Inyo county district attorneys to investigate their employees. They stated that their tribe&amp;rsquo;s status as a sovereign nation made them immune to state processes under federal law and asserted that the state authorized the seizure of tribal records. RBG concurred with the supreme court in dismissing their complaint suit.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salazar_v._Ramah_Navajo_Chapter">In Salazar_v. Ramah_Navajo Chapter, the issue in question was whether the US government, when it enters into a contract with a Native American (Indian) tribe for services, must pay contracts in full, even if Congress has not appropriated enough money to pay all tribal contractors. In a 5-4 decision, Ginsburg sided with the minority that stated the government shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Trading_Co._v._Shirley">In Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, the supreme court unanimously ruled against the Navajo nation that charged a hotel occupancy tax for providing services (police, fire, and ambulances) for fee land (non-indian territory within indian territory). The court ruled that the tribe&amp;rsquo;s imposition of a tax upon nonmembers on non-Indian fee land within the reservation was presumptively invalid without establishing that the tax was related to a consensual relationship with Atkinson.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiowa_Tribe_of_Oklahoma_v._Manufacturing_Technologies,_Inc.">In Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Ginsburg dissented with the majority, who ruled that an Indian Nation were entitled to sovereign immunity from contract lawsuits, whether made on or off reservation, or involving governmental or commercial activities.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_v._Native_Village_of_Venetie_Tribal_Government">In Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, the supreme court unanimously ruled against a tribal council who wanted to collect a tax from non-tribal members doing business on tribal lands. The Court decided unanimously that the land was not the tribe&amp;rsquo;s land subject to the tribal tax, even though it was owned by the tribe, because it was not part of a Native American reservation. Because all but one reservation in Alaska (the Annette Island reservation of the Tsimshian) had been eliminated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, the decision had the practical effect of prohibiting almost all Indian tribes in Alaska from collecting taxes for activities conducted on tribal land. &lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%26_L_Enterprises,_Inc._v._Citizen_Band,_Potawatomi_Indian_Tribe_of_Oklahoma">In C &amp;amp; L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band, Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, Ginsburg in her unanimous court opinion stated that: &amp;ldquo;An Indian tribe has sovereignty and is immune from suit in a state court unless that immunity has been specifically abrogated by the United States Congress or clearly waived by the tribe. In this case, the Potawatomie Tribe entered into a contract, using a contract form that the tribe provided, that agreed to arbitration and to having the dispute heard in state court. This is a clear waiver of the tribe&amp;rsquo;s sovereign immunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/ruth-bader-ginsburg-can-learn-from-justice-kavanaugh">RBG hired 1 POC staffer in 25 years. Kavanaugh, a conservative justice, has 25% POC out of his 48 law clerks. One writer noted that Kavanaughs views on affirmative action don&amp;rsquo;t reflect his diverse hiring practices, while Ginsburg&amp;rsquo;s progressive views don&amp;rsquo;t extend to her chambers. This is an improvement from her 13-year tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, when Ginsburg never had any black clerks. When this issue was raised during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1993, Ginsburg said: “If you confirm me for this job, my attractiveness to black candidates is going to improve.” That promise was ignored.&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-bader-ginsburg-can-learn-something-from-brett-kavanaugh/2018/10/15/b8974a86-cd77-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html">2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/03/the-rise-of-the-ruth-bader-ginsburg-cult">Her best friend on the court was the most racist, conservative justice in modern times, Scalia.&lt;/a> In the fawning book &lt;em>Notorious RBG&lt;/em>, one of the few mentions of race is in the book’s discussion of Bush v. Gore, the contentious decision that decided the 2000 presidential election. The authors mention that Ginsburg’s draft of her dissent had a footnote alluding to the possible suppression of Black voters in Florida. Justice Scalia responded to this draft by flying into a rage, telling Ginsburg that she was using “Al Sharpton tactics.” Ginsburg removed the footnote before it saw the light of day. This anecdote’s inclusion in the book is baffling, as Ginsburg contemplates calling anti-Black racism in the most facile of ways. But when her friend Justice Scalia plucks an argument straight from right-wing talk radio to shame her out of doing so, Ginsburg instantly capitulates. Scalia called the Voting rights act &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/in-voting-rights-scalia-sees-a-racial-entitlement">&amp;ldquo;racial entitlement&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, opposed women&amp;rsquo;s rights, and consistently defended anti-gay measures, yet these views did not stop her calling Scalia her &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10990156/scalia-ginsburg-friends">&amp;ldquo;best buddy&amp;rdquo; on the court, their families even spending every new year together.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

Carr, the Kansas Supreme Court had overturned a pair of death sentences, on the grounds that the defendants’ Eighth Amendment rights had been violated in the instructions given to the jury. The U.S. Supreme swooped in, informing Kansas that it had made a mistake; nobody’s Eighth Amendment rights had been violated, thus the defendants ought to have continued unimpeded along the path toward execution. The Court’s decision was 8-1, with Ginsburg putting her name on Justice Scalia’s majority opinion.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heien_v._North_Carolina">In Heien v.

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/taylor-v-barkes/">In Taylor v. Barkes, she concurred with the Court that held that the family of a suicidal man who was jailed and then killed himself could not sue the jail for failing to implement anti-suicide measures.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieves_v._Bartlett">In Nieves v Bartlett, agreed that cops should be protected from lawsuits as long as they cite probable cause in the original arrest.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_v._Harris">In Scott v. Harris, a high-speed chase involved a motorist being paralyzed after the cop ran his car off the road. Since the motorist had no charges or suspicion, the court was asked to decide whether the chase consititued unreasonable search and seizure, and whether running a car off the road constitutes deadly force that should be liable to lawsuits. Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, argued that the videotape evidence was not decisive, as the majority claimed it to be, and that a jury should determine if deadly force was justified. He stated a jury should be used, instead of the case &amp;ldquo;being decided by a group of elderly appellate judges&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
