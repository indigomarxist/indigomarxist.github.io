      <description>pdf Why Nietzsche is a terrible role model for the left Instead of writing up a longer, meandering argument against Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, I found that his quotations themselves make the strongest argument for why he makes a terrible role model for the left.
The core concepts of his philosophy, Masculine virtue and elitism, the Superman, Will to Power, worship of warrior heroes and militarism, Anti-democracy, Anti-Socialism, Reverence for hereditary Aristocracy (whether Teutonic, or Roman), Anti-feminism, Anti-Christianity / Buddism, Biological determinism, are shown through his quotes.</description>

      <description>pdf Friendly Feudalism: The Tibet Myth (2007) Michael Parenti 2007-01
Original publication: michaelparenti.org
Updated and expanded version from January 2007.
Contents For Lords and Lamas Secularization vs. Spirituality Exit Feudal Theocracy References For Lords and Lamas Along with the blood drenched landscape of religious conflict there is the experience of inner peace and solace that every religion promises, none more so than Buddhism. Standing in marked contrast to the intolerant savagery of other religions, Buddhism is neither fanatical nor dogmatic &amp;mdash; so say its adherents.</description>

      <description>pdf Burn the Constitution To emphasize the commonality of the 99 percent, to declare deep enmity of interest with the 1 percent, is to do exactly what the governments of the United States, and the wealthy elite allied to them-from the Founding Fathers to now-have tried their best to prevent. Madison feared a &amp;ldquo;majority faction&amp;rdquo; and hoped the new Constitution would control it. He and his colleagues began the Preamble to the Constitution with the words &amp;ldquo;We the people &amp;hellip;,&amp;rdquo; pretending that the new government stood for everyone, and hoping that this myth, accepted as fact, would ensure &amp;ldquo;domestic tranquility.</description>

      <description>Why Torrents are better than streaming servers as a self hosted solution. Instead of using plex or emby, consider using a dedicated torrent server, and torrent clients elsewhere.
Quality Streaming servers can never have the same quality as local music / video players. Video streaming servers like plex or emby, often have to transcode / convert the video to lower-quality formats. Native video players can handle x265. Audio streaming servers often can&amp;rsquo;t handle high quality formats like flac, whereas local media players can handle these easily.</description>
