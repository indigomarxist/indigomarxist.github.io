      <description>Why Nietzsche is a terrible role model for the left Instead of writing up a longer, meandering argument against Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, I found that his quotations themselves make the strongest argument for why he makes a terrible role model for the left.
The core concepts of his philosophy, Masculine virtue and elitism, the Superman, Will to Power, worship of warrior heroes and militarism, Anti-democracy, Anti-Socialism, Reverence for hereditary Aristocracy (whether Teutonic, or Roman), Anti-feminism, Anti-Christianity / Buddism, Biological determinism, are shown through his quotes.</description>
