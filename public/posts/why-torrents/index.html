<h3>Why Torrents</h3>

<h1 id="why-torrents-are-better-than-streaming-servers-as-a-self-hosted-solution">Why Torrents are better than streaming servers as a self hosted solution.</h1>
<p>Instead of using plex or emby, consider using a dedicated torrent server, and torrent clients elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Streaming servers can <strong>never</strong> have the same quality as local music / video players.
<ul>
<li>Video streaming servers like plex or emby, often have to transcode / convert the video to lower-quality formats. Native video players can handle <code>x265</code>.</li>
<li>Audio streaming servers often can&rsquo;t handle high quality formats like <code>flac</code>, whereas local media players can handle these easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="amount-of-content">Amount of Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>The content on streaming services are limited to what you <em>specifically</em> have downloaded. This can never match the hundreds of thousands of torrents being shared by people across the globe. Search sites like <a href="https://torrents-csv.ml/">Torrents.csv</a> have often faster searching than self-hosted solutions (and you can self host the searching if you wish).</li>
<li>Which is better, having a collection of <em>my music</em>, or having a collection of <em>all music</em>?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choice-of-media-player">Choice of media player</h2>
<ul>
<li>With torrents, I can use <strong>any media player I want</strong>. Most OSs make this as simple as a double-click to play media. VLC / MPV can natively play high quality video and audio, x265, flac, opus, etc.</li>
<li>With streamers, I&rsquo;m forced either to use a web client, or their own (often proprietary, sometimes paid) app. I prefer open-source standards like VLC.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="availability--reliability">Availability / Reliability</h2>
<ul>
<li>Torrents have effectively solved the data distribution problem: content is shared in a web of connections, and a torrent with more than one seeder is already more resilient than the strongest streaming server.
<ul>
<li>Why should there be 10,000 separate streaming services, not helping each other host or share the data, when torrents have made it so 10,000 clients <strong>are helping each other share the data</strong>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Services like plex don&rsquo;t offer this shared hosting.</li>
<li>Music / content is often removed from services like youtube frequently. Torrents can never be removed.</li>
<li>People often goto video streaming sites, and these are taken down rapidly. Many torrents have been reliably shared for 10+ years.</li>
<li>What about hardware failure? If your streaming servers hard drive goes down, you lost everything. With torrents, any with more than one seeder is safe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Streaming servers require you to set up a web server, often requiring you to learn nginx / apache, as well as follow various setup processes for the services themselves. This is understandable for some tech-oriented people, but what about a non-techie, who just likes music / movies? Why should they be required to learn these tools?
<ul>
<li>Content should be available <strong>for all</strong>, regardless of technical skill, or ability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downloading a torrent, and enjoying the media, involves:
<ul>
<li>Clicking a download magnet link. Wait for it to finish.</li>
<li>Open it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="caching--saving--streaming">Caching / Saving / Streaming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many of us don&rsquo;t have data, or are often in areas where data is spotty.
<ul>
<li>Its often a <em>feature</em> of services like plex to be able to save media locally, to avoid this problem. This is default with torrents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Torrent clients like qbittorrent and libretorrent for android let you <em>download files in sequential order</em>, IE stream, at the click of a button.</li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://torrents-csv.ml">Torrents.csv</a> let you search for files within torrents, so you can easily download / stream individual songs.</li>
<li>Its your choice where things are downloaded to. You can have a desktop or server with a highly available torrent client, and/or a smartphone torrent client.</li>
