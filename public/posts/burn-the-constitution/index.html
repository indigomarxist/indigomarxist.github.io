<h1 id="burn-the-constitution">Burn the Constitution</h1>
<p>To emphasize the commonality
of the 99 percent, to declare deep enmity of interest with the 1 percent, is to do exactly what the
governments of the United States, and the wealthy elite allied to them-from the Founding Fathers to
now-have tried their best to prevent. Madison feared a &ldquo;majority faction&rdquo; and hoped the new
Constitution would control it. He and his colleagues began the Preamble to the Constitution with
the words &ldquo;We the people &hellip;,&rdquo; pretending that the new government stood for everyone, and hoping
that this myth, accepted as fact, would ensure &ldquo;domestic tranquility.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-constitution">What is the Constitution?</h2>
<p>A constitution is a set of fundamental principles and precedents according to which a state or an organization is governed. As a <strong>foundational document</strong>, it outlines the relationship between its subsections, defines how laws are made, what</p>
<h2 id="the-problems">The problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cult of the constitution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-were-the-framers">Who were the framers?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is an almost religious devotion to which most citizens hold up both the constitution, and the framers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As is the case with any codified document of law or principles, its important to figure out in whose interest it was written. There is no such thing as a neutral political document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A class analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By discovering this, we can go beyond apparantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neutrality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reforming-the-constitution">Reforming the Constitution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limits of reformism. How does it get changed? Go through history of amendments. Mass struggle, revolts, protests, etc.</li>
<li>Go through how each clause oppresses workers in some way.</li>
<li>Never be deceived that the rich will allow you to vote away their wealth.</li>
<li>​</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stop holding a highly flawed and vague document as an infallible religious text.</li>
<li>Stop glorifying the framers as enlightened beings, when in reality they were the class enemies of the workers then, just as much as now.</li>
<li>Realize that bourgeois political processes cannot reform the constitution. Improvements only occur when politicians are threatened by violence and instability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>Things that were legal, and enforced by the police:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holocaust</li>
<li>Slavery</li>
<li>Segregation</li>
</ul>
