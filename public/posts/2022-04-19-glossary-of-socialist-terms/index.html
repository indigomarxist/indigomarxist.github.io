<td>The section of the international working class whose privileged position in lucrative job markets opened up by imperialism guarantees its receipt of wages approaching or exceeding the per capita value created by the working class as a whole. The class interests of the labor aristocracy are bound up with those of the capitalist class, such that if the latter is unable to accumulate superprofits then the super-wages of the labor aristocracy must be reduced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Marxism">Bourgeois Democracy</a></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://theimmortalscience.wordpress.com/2017/02/27/the-state-and-revolution-an-overview/">The State</a></td>
<td>In Leninism, the state is a <em>special organization of force</em> used for the suppression of one class by another. Under capitalist society, the state upholds capitalism and wields force to suppress the working class. In socialism, state power is held by workers and uses force to suppress the capitalist class. In general terms, a state is any politically organized community under a single government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism">Imperialism</a></td>
<td>The domination of a weaker country by a stronger one; referring primarily to the conquering and exploitation of the land, labor, and natural resources of the weaker country. In Leninism, imperialism is the final stage of capitalism, where finance capital is exported to undeveloped economies, resulting in the colonization and division of the world amongst capitalist monopolies. Geopolitical conflict ensues over this economic exploitation, and the resulting super-profits permit businessmen to bribe native politicians and labor leaders, and intervene militarily to suppress worker revolts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">Nationalism</a></td>

<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution">Revolution</a></td>
<td>A fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. In Marxism, a revolution is expropriation and smashing of existing property relations, with the proletariat being the only truly revolutionary class that can enact this social transformation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process)">Praxis</a></td>
<td>The act of engaging, applying, exercising, realizing, or practicing ideas. Theory in action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat">Dictatorship of the Proletariat</a></td>
<td>A transitional state of affairs, between capitalism and communism, in which the working class holds political power, and is in the process of changing the means of production from private, to social ownership. Dictatorship doesn&rsquo;t refer to an autocracy, but rather that the working class now dictates what happens in society.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism">Dialectical Materialism</a></td>
<td>The evolution of the natural world and the emergence of new qualities of being at new stages of evolution.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value">Labor theory of value</a></td>

<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_revolution">Permanent Revolution</a></td>
<td>In Marxism, the strategy of a revolutionary class to continue to pursue its class interests independently and without compromise, despite overtures for political alliances, and despite the political dominance of opposing sections of society. In Trotskyism, PR holds that the only way to achieve world communism is to allow the revolution to spread unimpeded from nation to nation, the theory that a revolution in one nation would ignite revolutionary fervor worldwide, and that full scale working class revolution must be allowed to germinate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism#National_self-determination">Right of nations to self-determination</a></td>
<td>In Lenin&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness.&rdquo; In short, its much easier to fight a one front war against local capitalists, than a two front war against much more powerful imperialists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism">Democratic Centralism</a></td>
<td>A tenet of Leninism, described as, <em>diversity in discussion, unity in action.</em> After decisions are reached, they are followed by the group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguardism">Vanguardism</a></td>
<td>A strategy whereby the most class-conscious and politically advanced sections of the working class form organizations in order to draw larger sections of the workers towards revolutionary politics and serve as manifestations of proletarian political power against its class enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage_theory">Two Stage Theory</a></td>
<td>Argues that underdeveloped countries, such as Tsarist Russia, must first pass through a stage of capitalism before moving to a socialist stage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_line">Mass Line</a></td>
<td>In Mao-Zedong-thought, a method of growing class consciousness and communism, where communists consult the masses, interpret their ideas and suggestions within the framework of Marxism-Leninism, decide how to best solve those problems through collective action, and then enforce those resulting policies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike">Mass Strike</a></td>
<td>A strike action in which a substantial proportion of the total labor force in a city, region, or country participates, spreading class consciousness, and forcing capitalist concessions. Rosa Luxemburg identified it as one of the most powerful tactics available to workers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation">Alienation</a></td>
<td>A term used by Marx to denote the estrangement of workers under capitalism from the products of their labor, and themselves; the worker loses the ability to determine life and destiny, when deprived of the right to think of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define their relationships with other people; and to own the things produced by their own labor. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity, this worker is directed by the bourgeoisie, who own the means of production with which they must work to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a></td>
<td>In Mao-Zedong-thought, the idea that capitalist values do constantly re-appear within the communist party, although not uniformly. It is up to the people, who are the real motive force in world history, to call out and denounce capitalist values and corrupt people in positions of authority, and &ldquo;bombard the headquarters&rdquo;, to ensure the elimination of bourgeois values and cement proletarian power. In short, &ldquo;it is always right to rebel.&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front">United Front</a></td>
<td>In Trotskyism, an initiative whereby communists propose to join with all workers belonging to other parties and groups and all unaligned workers in a common struggle to defend the immediate, basic interests of the working class against the bourgeoisie. Through united struggle, many workers can be won over to revolutionary socialism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_demand">Transitional Demand</a></td>
<td>In Trotskyism, an agitational demand made by a socialist organization with the aim of linking the current situation to progress towards their goal of a socialist society. Transitional demands differ from calls for reform in that they call for things that governments and corporations are unwilling or unable to offer, and therefore, any progress towards obtaining a transitional demand is likely to weaken capitalism and strengthen the hand of the working class. Examples of transitional demands would be &ldquo;Employment for all&rdquo; or &ldquo;Housing for all&rdquo;; demands that sound reasonable to the average citizen, but are practically impossible for capitalism to deliver on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_power_(Russian_Revolution)">Dual Power</a></td>
<td>A tenet of Leninism, in which two powers, one proletarian (workers&rsquo; councils / direct democratic organizations) and one capitalist (the official state apparatus) coexist and compete for legitimacy, during the transition away from capitalism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%E2%80%93Maoism#People.27s_War">Protracted Peoples War</a></td>
<td>In Mao-Zedong-thought, a strategy for achieving communism that includes winning the support of the locals (usually the peasantry) in areas away from capitalist strongholds, waging unconventional guerrilla warfare, and building institutions of dual power to replace capitalist ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workers Militia</td>
<td>An important focus of Trotskyism, where local, self-organized working-class militias, fighting for their class interests, are the primary vehicle to achieve socialism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerationism">Accelerationism</a></td>
<td>The support for increasing the oppression of capitalism in the hope that class contradictions will reach a point that revolution will become more likely. Accelerationists might view our current situation as boiling a frog in water slowly, while a stark uptick in oppression will cause workers to revolt. Few communists support it, because it harms working people, and historically increased oppression hasn&rsquo;t lead to increased chance of revolt. What leads to revolution is actually socialist organization efforts, and a growth in class conciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality">Intersectionality</a></td>
<td>A term that signifies that the various forms of social stratification, such as class, race, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, disability and gender, do not exist separately from each other but are interwoven together, and must be attacked equally without neglecting any one axis.</td>
